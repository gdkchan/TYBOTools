Tadaima Yuusha Boshuuchuu Okawari translation toolkit

The plan is making tools to help translating this SNES game from Human Entertainment.
Currently it only contains a tool to decompress and compress the graphics scattered through the ROM.
All work here is released into the Public Domain, but please note that the compression algorithms here were not created by me, and the implementation is the result of reverse engineering the game.
